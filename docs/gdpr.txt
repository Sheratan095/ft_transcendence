• Minor module: GDPR compliance options with user anonymization, local data
management, and account deletion.
The goal of this minor module is to introduce GDPR compliance options that allow
users to exercise their data privacy rights. Key features and objectives include:
◦ Implement GDPR-compliant features that enable users to request anonymization of their personal data, ensuring that their identity and sensitive information are protected.
◦ Provide tools for users to manage their local data, including the ability to
view, edit, or delete their personal information stored within the system.
◦ Offer a streamlined process for users to request the permanent deletion of
their accounts, including all associated data, ensuring compliance with data
protection regulations.
◦ Maintain clear and transparent communication with users regarding their data
privacy rights, with easily accessible options to exercise these rights.
This minor module aims to enhance user privacy and data protection by offering
GDPR compliance options that empower users to control their personal information
and exercise their data privacy rights within the system.
If you are not familiar with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), it
is essential to understand its principles and implications, especially regarding user
data management and privacy. The GDPR is a regulation that aims to protect the
personal data and privacy of individuals within the European Union (EU) and the
European Economic Area (EEA). It sets out strict rules and guidelines for organizations on how they should handle and process personal data.
To gain a better understanding of the GDPR and its requirements, it is strongly
recommended to visit the official website of the European Commission on data
protection1
. This website provides comprehensive information about the GDPR,
including its principles, objectives, and user rights. It also offers additional resources to delve deeper into the topic and ensure compliance with the regulation.
