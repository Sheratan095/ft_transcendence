nodemon (short for node monitor) is a development utility that automatically restarts your Node.js application when files change.
So, instead of running:
	node index.js
and manually restarting the server each time you edit a file, you just do:
	nodemon index.js
and it watches your files, restarting automatically whenever you save changes.

	npm install --save-dev nodemon

In package.json add:
"scripts":
{
	"dev": "nodemon index.js",
	"start": "node index.js"
}

and then run 
	npm run dev

nodemon.json configuration file:
"watch"	Directories or files to watch for changes
"ext"	:	File extensions that trigger a restart
"ignore":	Paths or patterns to ignore
"exec"	:	Command to run when nodemon starts
"env"	:	Environment variables available in the process
"verbose"	:	Controls how much detail nodemon prints to the console (log)
"delay"	:	Defines how long nodemon waits after detecting a file change before restarting your app

example:
{
	"watch": ["src"],
	"ext": "js,json",
	"ignore": ["node_modules"],
	"exec": "node src/index.js"
}
